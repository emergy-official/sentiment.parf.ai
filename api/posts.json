Here, I will share my learning journey as I build a new website.\n\n## What I've accomplished\n\n1. **Installing Astro**: First, I created a new Astro project and set up my online accounts.\n\n2. **Making Pages**: I then learned how to make pages by creating new `.astro` files and placing them in the `src/pages/` folder.\n\n3. **Making Blog Posts**: This is my first blog post! I now have Astro pages and Markdown posts!\n\n## What's next\n\nI will finish the Astro tutorial, and then keep adding more posts. Watch this space for more to come.",
